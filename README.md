Movie Recommendation system

About this project
This dataset contains metadata for 45,000 movies released on or before July 2017, all listed in the MovieLens database. This project embarks on a journey to create a personalized movie recommender system, transforming this vast dataset into a tool that can predict and suggest movies tailored to individual tastes and preferences.

The main objective of this project is to develop a robust and accurate movie recommender system. The system aims to:

Enhance User Experience: Provide users with personalized movie recommendations based on their viewing history and preferences.

Improve Content Discovery: Help users discover new movies that they might not have found on their own.

Increase User Engagement: Encourage users to spend more time on the platform by continuously suggesting relevant and interesting content.

Approach

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

   Handling missing values.
   Formatting and normalizing data for consistency.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understanding the distribution of genres, ratings, and other key features.
Identifying patterns and trends in the data.
3. Feature Engineering:

Creating meaningful features such as average ratings, popularity scores, and user preferences.
4. Building the Recommender System:

A Basic Recommendation System Based on weigthed rating
Collaborative Filtering: Using user-item interaction data to recommend movies based on similar user preferences.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommending movies similar to those a user has liked based on movie metadata such as genres, cast, and plot summaries.
